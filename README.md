### Common Issues

1. **"No data scraped" error**: 
   - Ensure the URL is a valid Google Maps search result
   - Check if the page loads completely
   - Verify the search returns business listings

2. **Server won't start**:
   - Check if port 3000 is available
   - Ensure all dependencies are installed
   - Check Node.js version (requires 14+)

3. **Scraping timeout**:
   - The scraper has a 60-second timeout
   - Slow internet connections may need more time
   - Complex pages may require longer processing

### Performance Tips

- Use specific search terms for better results
- Avoid very broad searches (e.g., "businesses in USA")
- Close other browser tabs to free up memory

## Security Notes

- The scraper runs in headless mode for security
- No data is stored on the server
- All processing happens locally
- Respect Google's terms of service and rate limits
